SourceLevel has just announced they are doing a FREE mini-series on code reviews.

By subscribing via email, you will get a new email each day for a week. The course will teach you:
- Benefits of a code review
- How to submit a PR
- How to review a PR
- Linters and styleguides

While the course certainly is not for everyone, it is a friendly introduction to the code review for developers who have not done them before. [Check out the course here!](https://sourcelevel.io/code-review-nano-course)
