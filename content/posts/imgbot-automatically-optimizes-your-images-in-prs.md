Chances are: the images on your site aren't fully optimized. Fix this with Imgbot, a GitHub application that will automatically optimize your images! The compression is lossless, so you get smaller files and faster loading times with no downside.

Imgbot hooks into your GitHub Pull Requests and can be configured with a `.imgbotconfig` json file. For example, you can
- ignore specific files/directories
- enable aggressive (lossy) compression
- schedule compressions
