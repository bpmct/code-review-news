[CodeStream](https://codestream.com) recently released their code reviews feature, allowing developers to request and perform code reviews inside their IDE. Unlike code reviews inside a web browser with a service like GitHub, CodeStream code reviews:
- Are inside the IDE (VS Code and JetBrains IDEs)
- Do not require PRs, code reviews can be performed on local commits or even uncomitted code.
- Can automatically send Slack notifications to teammates
- Allow comments on any code, not just the diffs from the current review.
