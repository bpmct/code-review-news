In January, the GitLab team introduced [v12.7](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/code_review_analytics.html), which includes Code Review Analytics reporting. The feature makes it easy for team leads to diagnose slow response times and understand code review patterns.

With access to these statistics, it makes it easier for teams to understand strengths and weaknesses in their code review process.
