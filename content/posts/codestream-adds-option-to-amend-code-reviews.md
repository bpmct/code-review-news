In-IDE code review tool, CodeStream just released v7.4, which includes the ability to update an existing code review.

When adding comments to a code review, the reviewer has the option to make the comment a "Change Request." Now, the code author can make the necessary changes and amend the review to include them. That way, any code changes can be reviewed again without the need of adding a new review.
