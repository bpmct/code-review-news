Andrew U, Product Manager at Practicum bootcamps understands that code reviews are essential. However, it can be hard for novice programmers to ask for feedback on their code:

> Yet, it's really hard to approach someone for help and share your code if you know that your project performs like this tractor. That's why in the very beginning I've just kept silent and made crappy projects.

At Practium, code reviews start on day 1 to ensure students are writing quality code. Here's how it works:
```
ðŸš€ Students send their repos for a code review after each project
ðŸš€ Their GitHub account gets connected to Practicum, so after updating code students just click on a button and send their work to a reviewer immediately
ðŸš€ After project is reviewed line by line, a professional developer leaves comments for each student
ðŸš€ Students get 4 iterations of code review per project
ðŸš€ If students feel stuck they can ask a tutor for help or study material before sending their work for another review
```
